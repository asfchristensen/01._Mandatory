        Not a language nor a framework.<br><br>
        Node.js is an open source, server-side-runtime environment to execute JavaScript code outside a
        browser.<br><br>
        It has a JavaScript engine called <span class="emphasis">"v8"</span> that can execute JavaScript
        code.<br><br>
        It's capable of running on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, MacOs etc. and uses JavaScript
        server-side.
        You can make REST APIs, console apps, scripts and interact with databases.<br><br><br>

        <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3><br>
        JavaScript is singlethreaded and therefor only executes one thing at a time, but Node.js is
        multithreaded, non-blocking
        and asynchronous by default, which makes it ideal for handling I/O-intensive apps. Therefor, with node
        it is possible
        to handle several requests without blocking any of them.<br><br><br>

        <h3 id="modules">Modules</h3><br>
        Every file is defined as a module, which means that Node.js does not execute the code directly. First it
        "wraps" the code in a module. By doing this you achieve encapsulation and have a well defined scope for 
        functions and variables inside the files.<br><br><br>

        <h3 id="engines">JavaScript Engines</h3><br>
        <div class="box-info">
            Any browser has a JavaScript engine that takes JavaScript code and converts it to machinge code,
            so a computer can understand it. Firefox uses "SpiderMonkey", Internet Explorer uses "Chakra" and
            and Chrome uses <span class="emphasis">"v8"</span> . This is why JavaScript code gets displayed
            differently depending on the browser.
