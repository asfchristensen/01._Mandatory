    <h1>Fetch</h1><br><br>

    <h6>
        "fetch" is a built-in method in web browsers that allows the client to make HTTP requests to a 
        server, retrieve data from it and recieve a response. The method returns a <span class="emphasis">promise</span> 
        object that resolves to the response object (the response from the server to the client).<br><br><br>

    <h3 id="promise"> Promise</h3><br>
        <div class="box-info">
            An object that respresents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
            It provides a way to handle asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way. When you 
            fetch data, the response is a promise object, which can have 3 states:<br><br>
            <p>
                - Pending: initial state<br>
                - Fulfilled: the operation successfully completed<br>
                - Rejected: the operation fails
            </p>
            To handle these states, the "promise" object uses ".then" (that registers a callback function to 
            be invoked) or "await" (allows to wait for a promise) - to be fulfilled or rejected. 
        </div><br><br>

        <h3 id="then">.then</h3><br>
        This provides a global fetch() method that returns a promise that resolves to the response object.
        Following code example fetches from an endpoint from app.js routes. 
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/api/visitors", (req, res) => {
            res.send({ data: visitorCount });
        });


        fetch("/api/visitors")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(result => {
            // the "data" refers to the "data" key in res.send from app.js
            updateVisitorCount(result.data);
        });


        function updateVisitorCount(visitorCount) {
            const visitorCountDiv = document.getElementById("visitor-count");
            visitorCountDiv.innerText = visitorCount;
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        After having fetched from the "/api/visitors" the response.json() method is used to extract the JSON content 
        from the HTTP response. The method returns a promise that resolves to the JSON data contained in the response body
        which is now a JavaScript object. You can also use the other HTTP methods with this fetch-form:<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.put("/api/visitors", (req, res) => {
            res.send({ data: ++visitorCount });
        });

        function writeInVisitorLog() {
            fetch("/api/visitors", {
                method: "PUT",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                }
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(result => updateVisitorCount(result.data));
        }
    </code>
</pre><br>
        <h3 id="async-await">async/await</h3><br>
        These are keywords that are used to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style. <span class="emphasis">async</span>
        declares that the function should be run asynchronous, which means that the rest of the application can 
        still run without any interruptions. <span class="emphasis">await</span> is used inside the "async" to wait 
        for a promise to be fulfilled. This way the code waits for the promise and returns the result.<br><br>

        This provides a global fetch() method that returns a promise that resolves to the response object.
        More modern approach for making requests. Just another way instead of the above.<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        async function fetchVisitorCount () {
            const response = await fetch("/api/visitors");
            const result = await response.json();
            console.log(result.data);
        }
    </code>
</pre><br>
        This type of fetch uses "await" to wait for the fetch request to complete and then return the response.
        The same keyword is used again to wait for the response to be parsed to a JavaScript object. All this is 
        done asynchronously because of the "async".<br><br><br>

        <h3 id="response">response.?</h3><br>
        <div class="box-info">
            It's important to note that the "response." only works if the response method matches the data type that is 
            being fetched.<br><br>
    
            <h5>.json()</h5><br>
            Only works if the endpoint/URL you are fetching from returns data in JSON format.<br>
    <pre>
        <code>
            app.get("/api/tanks", (req, res) => {
                res.send({ data: tanksUtil.getTanks() });
            });
    
    
            fetch("/api/tanks")
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(result => console.log(result);
        </code>
    </pre>
                In this particular example the the endpoint "/api/tanks" has a body as a ByteStream (given by TCP) which is why
                it has to be converted to JSON.<br><br>
    
                <h5>.text()</h5><br>
                Only works if the endpoint/URL you are fetching from returns data in text format.<br>
    <pre>
        <code>
            app.get("/proxy", (req, res) => {
                // task make a request to https://www.google.com
                // task serve the text data
                fetch("https://www.google.com")
                .then(response => response.text())
                .then(result => res.send(result));
            });
        </code>
    </pre>
        </div><br><br>
        
        <h3 id="xss">XSS danger</h3><br>
        'Cross-Site Scripting' is a type of security vulnerability that accours, when an attacker injects malicious
        code into a web application, which then executes in the browser of other users who visit the website. This can 
        happen because many inputs from aplications are not validated or filtered properly. The attacker typically uses 
        either HTML-tags or attributes to inject data.<br><br> 

        <div class="box-important">
            E.g. it is bad with .innerHTML when fetching data from an API. If you do, you risk getting malicious 
            script-tags (XSS), which can be implemented in the application and infect the server:<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        async function fetchTanks() {
            const response = await fetch("/api/tanks");
            const data = await response.json();
        }


        async function showTanks() {
            const divTanks = document.getElementById('tanks-wrapper');
            for (tank in this.data) {
                divTanks.innerHTML += `< div >${ tank.name }< /div >`
            }
        }
    </code>
</pre>
            Here the "tank.name" could have been a malicious script that would get implemented in the system. 
        </div><br><br>

        <h5>Examples when XSS can happen</h5><br>
        <p>
            - Missing input validation (as the code above)<br><br>
            - DOM manipulation<br><br>
            - Bad output encoding<br>
            (if the data doesn't get presented correct then special characters can be rendered/executed by the browser)<br><br>
            - Error setting HTTP headers<br><br>
            - Error setting Content-Type header<br>
            (can cause the browser not interpreting the data as HTML or JavaScript, but interprets the data a plain text, and 
            then the browser can accidently execute the data as code)   
        </p><br>

    <h3 id="sanitize">Sanitize the inputs with npm package</h3><br>
    <div class="box-info">
        When sanitizing inputs from an API or a client, you make sure the inputs can never be a script - it will always escape 
        HTML. Here you can use a npm package called <a href="/packages#escape">escape-html</a> that lets you escape certain HTML 
        characters. The package helps "sanitize" the code.<br><br>
        
        Besides "escape-html" package, there is another package called "xss" (which we haven't been working with in the class). This 
        is also a third-party module that has to importet into the Node.js project. When using "xss" it sanitizes user input by 
        removing potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes. This is in contrast to "escape-html" that escapes these characters instead.<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        import xss from "xss";

        const input = '< a href="#" onclick="stealUserSession()" >Click me< /a >';
        const xssSanitation = xss(input);

        console.log(xssSanitation); // & lt;a href="#"& gt;CLick me& lt;/a& gt; 
    </code>
</pre>
            As the code example shows, the "xssSanitation" has removed the "onclick" attribute because of a potential risk. But the a-tag 
            has been kept, since this tag doesn't do any harm.
