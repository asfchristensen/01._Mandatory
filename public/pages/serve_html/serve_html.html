    <h1>Serving HTML</h1><br><br>

    <h6>
        After having set up the server and app.js file (see <a href="/app_setup">app.js setup</a>) you can then add frontend to you application, and 
        serve static files.<br><br><br>

        <h3 id="modules">Modules to use</h3><br>
        <h5>path (built-in module)</h5><br>
        Part of the Node.js core and is installed automatically when you install Node.js on the system. Here you don't need to use "npm install"
        like you do with Express. It can simply be imported into the project.<br><br>

        It provides functions for working with the file -and directory paths.<br><br> 

        <h5>fs (built-in module)</h5><br>
        Part of the Node.js core and is installed automatically when you install Node.js on the system. Here you don't need to use "npm install"
        like you do with Express. It can simply be imported into the project.<br><br>

        Used to work with the file system on the computer, and provides methods for reading, writing and manipulating files and directories.<br><br><br>
        
        <h3 id="serve-static">Serve static files</h3><br>
        In the app.js file you need to use the middleware function "static" in Express to serve static files, when you use the Express framework:<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.use(express.static("public"));
    </code>
</pre>
        The code tells Express to serve static files from the "public" directory at the root of the server.<br><br> 

        <div class="box-important">
            Express does not by default allow serving static files. A client/browser can only download the files by calling:
            "app.use(express.static("public"));". This is in contrast to Spring and Thymeleaf, where Spring, behind the scenes,
            declares the ressources folder as static for us.
        </div><br><br> 

        <h3 id="security">Security need for serving static files</h3><br>
        <div class="box-info">
                Express has a "static folder" that can contain static files. In that folder you pass a "public folder" as a parameter that contains all the client-side files: 
                html, js and css. This means that everything in that particular public folder can be accessed by the client. When writing "app.use(express.static("public"));" you 
                basically say that it is <i>allowed</i> to access the files within. The client can, in the browser, write e.g.:
    <pre>
        <code>
            https://localhost:8080/frontpage/frontpage.js
        </code>
    </pre>
                Then the client will see the "frontpage.js" file in text-format in the browser. If the public folder was not defined in the static folder from Express, it would 
                have given an error.<br><br>
    
                This is why it is important to "serve"/define client-files in the static folder, or else there will be a <span class="emphasis">security hole</span>, because 
                then the client (or potential attacker) can access sensitive files or directories on your server. Let us say you have a file called "passwords.txt" in the project 
                directory that contains sensitive information - if you don't use "express.static" an attacker could access the file by guessing its location on the server, and by 
                typing the URL to the file in the browser:
    <pre>
        <code>
            https://localhost:8080/security-folder/passwords.txt 
        </code>
    </pre>
                With "express.static" the files inside are the only files accessible to the client. No others. Even if the attacker guesses the path, the person will have no access. 
        </div><br><br>

        <h3 id="ways">Ways of sending a static file</h3><br>
        <h5 id="dirname">res.sendFile(__dirname + "/path");</h5><br>
        One way of sending a HTML page to the client as a response that takes an absolute path as argument. "__dirname" variable is a special global 
        variable that holds the absolute path of the directory that contains the script. "/path" represents the relative path to the file. Always 
        remember the "/" in front on the path.<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/tanks", (req, res) => {
            res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/tanks/tanks.html");
        });
    </code>
</pre> 
            <div class="box-important">
                If you had to write the absolute path every time (hardcoded) without the __dirname variable, it would:<br><br>
                <p>
                    - Limit the code to a specific OS system<br>
                    - Share information about yourself (name, system..)<br>
                    - Make rigid code (all users have to change the path)
                </p> 
            </div><br><br>

            <h5 id="path">res.sendFile(path.resolve("path"));</h5><br>
            Another way is to use this method to send a HTML page to the client as a response. The "path" module resolves a sequence of paths or path
            segments (strings) into an absolute path. You only have to write the relative path as a parameter, which makes it more dynamic and can be 
            used by everybody who works on the project. Never use the "/" in front of the path.<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/tanks", (req, res) => {
            res.sendFile(path.resolve("public/tanks/tanks.html");
        });
    </code>
</pre> 
            <h5 id="fs-module">res.send(fs.readFileSync().toString());</h5><br>
            This method is a built-in function of the "fs" module that reads the contents of a file synchronously and returns a "Buffer" object containing 
            the file data - that's why you need to call .toString() to convert the buffer to a string format. Because it is read synchronously the execution 
            of the program will be blocked until the file has been fully read.<br><br>

            <div class="box-important">
                This approach has a couple of potential issues:<br><br> 
                <p>
                    1) Reading files sync. can give performance issues<br><br>
                    2) The file content are being sent as a string which can be inefficient for large files.<br><br>
                    3) Reading large files can cause the server to become unresponsive or crash if multiple 
                    requests are made concurrently. 
                </p>
            </div><br>
            
            But this is exactly what we want when making SSR because we want to block the server from executing the files before every 
            file has been read. Then you only need to render the pages 1 time when the server starts (see <a href="/ssr_csr">SSR & CSR</a>)<br><br>

            OBS: when working in a development environment and use nodemon that constantly updates the application whenever changes have been made, 
            then you have to add a "nodemon.json" file with:<br>
<pre>
    <code>
        {
            "ext": "js, json, html"
        }
    </code>
</pre>
            And write "nodemon --ext html,js filename.js" (see <a href="/terminal#update-with-sync">terminal</a>)<br><br><br>
            
            <h5 id="send">res.send(parameter);</h5><br>
            This method sends a response to the client with specified content as a parameter:<br><br>
            <p>
                - Clean HTML
            </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/about", (req,res) => {
            res.send(`
                < h1 >About< /h1 >
                < h3 >This is my about page.< /h3 >
            `);
        });   
    </code>
</pre>        
            <p>
                - Rendered page
            </p><br>
            When writing "rendered page" it refers to the HTML content that has been generated by a template engine (one custom designed for this -and future projects). 
            This rendered page have been read by "fs.readFileSync().toString()" and rendered before it is sent to the client, which is the core of SSR (see <a href="/ssr_csr">SSR & CSR</a>).
